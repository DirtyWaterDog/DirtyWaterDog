- 👋 Hi, I’m @DirtyWaterDog
- 👀 I’m interested in ... improving software either through design ideas and/or getting my hands dirty (coding)! I would like to see UNIX/LINUX software improve bigly!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... life is a constant teacher. I suppose you never really stop learning, right?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... software design ideas and how to make that software better.
- 📫 How to reach me ... good question! ... "have your people contact my people." ;-) Lol!
